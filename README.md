## Requirements
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn

# You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

# Clone repository
```bash
 git remote add origin https://github.com/AviralTechie/ViLearnX-Task-2.git
```
## Files
* iris.csv: The Iris dataset file in CSV format.
* task-2.ipynb : Python script for data analysis and visualization.

1. Load the Iris Dataset
* Reads the Iris dataset from iris.csv.

## Model Training
1. The script linear_regression.py performs the following steps:

* Load and preprocess the dataset.
* Split the data into training and testing sets.
* Train a simple linear regression model on the training set.
* Evaluate the model on the testing set using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
2. Place the iris.csv file in the same directory as the <filename> script.
3. Run the script using Python:
```bash
python analysis.py
```
